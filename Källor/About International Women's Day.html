    <h1>About International Women's Day</h1>

    <p>International Women's Day (IWD) is celebrated annually on March 8.</p>

    <p>The day has occurred for well over a century, with the first IWD gathering in 1911.</p>

    <p>The day is not country, group or organization specific - and belongs to all groups collectively everywhere.</p>

    <p>Gloria Steinem, world-renowned feminist, journalist and activist 
        <a href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/External.aspx?u=https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/herersquos-to-the-memory-of-gloria-steinem-and-the-other-women-who-struggled-for-equality/" target="_blank"><b>once explained</b></a>
 
        "The story of women's struggle for equality belongs to no single
 feminist nor to any one organization but to the collective 
        efforts of all who care about human rights."</p>

    <p>So make International Women's Day your day and do what you can to truly make a positive difference for women.</p>

    <h3>What is International Women's Day?</h3>

    <p>International Women's Day (March 8) is a global day celebrating 
the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The 
        day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity.</p>

    <p>No one government, NGO, charity, corporation, academic 
institution, women's network or media hub is solely responsible for 
International 
        Women's Day. Many organizations declare an annual IWD theme that
 supports their specific agenda or cause, and some of these are adopted 
        more widely with relevance than others. International Women's 
Day is a collective day of global celebration and a call for gender 
parity.</p>  

    <p>International Women's Day is all about unity, celebration, 
reflection, advocacy and action - whatever that looks like globally at a
 local 
        level. But one thing is for sure, International Women's Day has 
been occurring for well over a century - and continue's to grow from 
        strength to strength. Learn about the <a href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/Values"><b>values</b></a> that guide IWD's ethos.</p>

    <h3>What colours signify International Women's Day?</h3>

    <p>Internationally, purple is a colour for symbolising women. Historically the combination of purple, green and white to 
        symbolise women's equality originated from the Women's Social and Political Union in the UK in 1908. Purple signifies 
        justice and dignity. Green symbolises hope. White represents purity, but is no longer used due to 'purity' being a 
        controversial concept.</p>

    <h3>What's the history of IWD?</h3>

    <p>International Women's Day (IWD) has been observed since the early 1900's - a time of great expansion and turbulence in the 
        industrialized world that saw booming population growth and the rise of radical ideologies.</p>
		   
	<p><strong>1908</strong><br>
	    Great unrest and critical debate was occurring amongst women. Women's oppression and inequality was spurring women to 
        become more vocal and active in campaigning for change. Then in 1908, 15,000 women marched through New York City 
        demanding shorter hours, better pay and voting rights.</p>

	<p><strong>1909</strong><br>
	    In accordance with a declaration by the Socialist Party of America, the first National Woman's Day (NWD) was observed 
        across the United States on 28 February. Women continued to celebrate NWD on the last Sunday of February until 1913.</p>

	<p><strong>1910</strong><br>
	    In 1910 a second International Conference of Working Women was held
 in Copenhagen. A woman named Clara Zetkin (Leader of 
        the 'Women's Office' for the Social Democratic Party in Germany)
 tabled the idea of an International Women's Day. She 
        proposed that every year in every country there should be a 
celebration on the same day - a Women's Day - to press for 
        their demands. The conference of over 100 women from 17 
countries, representing unions, socialist parties, working 
        women's clubs - and including the first three women elected to 
the Finnish parliament - greeted Zetkin's suggestion with 
        unanimous approval and thus International Women's Day was the 
result.</p> 

	<p><strong>1911</strong><br>
	    Following the decision agreed at Copenhagen in 1911, International 
Women's Day was honoured the first time in Austria, Denmark, 
        Germany and Switzerland on 19 March. More than one million women
 and men attended IWD rallies campaigning for women's 
        rights to work, vote, be trained, to hold public office and end 
discrimination. However less than a week later on 25 March, 
        the tragic 'Triangle Fire' in New York City took the lives of 
more than 140 working women, most of them Italian and Jewish 
        immigrants. This disastrous event drew significant attention to 
working conditions and labour legislation in the United 
        States that became a focus of subsequent International Women's 
Day events. 1911 also saw women's 
        <a href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/External.aspx?u=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_Roses" target="blank">Bread and Roses</a>' campaign.</p>

	<p><strong>1913-1914</strong><br>
	    On the eve of World War I campaigning for peace, Russian women 
observed their first International Women's Day on the last Sunday 
        in February 1913. In 1913 following discussions, International 
Women's Day was transferred to 8 March and this day has 
        remained the global date for International Women's Day ever 
since. In 1914 further women across Europe held rallies to 
        campaign against the war and to express women's solidarity. For 
example, in London in the United Kingdom there was a march 
        from Bow to Trafalgar Square in support of women's suffrage on 8
 March 1914. Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested in front of 
        Charing Cross station on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square.</p>

	<p><strong>1917</strong><br>
	    On the last Sunday of February, Russian women began a strike for 
"bread and peace" in response to the death of over 2 million Russian 
        soldiers in World War 1. Opposed by political leaders, the women
 continued to strike until four days later the Czar was forced to 
        abdicate and the provisional Government granted women the right 
to vote. The date the women's strike commenced was Sunday 23 
        February on the Julian calendar then in use in Russia. This day 
on the Gregorian calendar in use elsewhere was 8 March.</p>

   	<p><strong>1975</strong><br>
	    International Women's Day was celebrated for the first time by the 
United Nations in 1975. Then in December 1977, the General 
        Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming a United Nations Day 
for Women’s Rights and International Peace to be observed on 
        any day of the year by Member States, in accordance with their 
historical and national traditions.</p>

	<p><strong>1996</strong><br>
        The UN commenced the adoption of an annual theme in 1996 - which
 was "Celebrating the past, Planning for the Future". This 
        theme was followed in 1997 with "Women at the Peace table", and 
in 1998 with "Women and Human Rights", and in 1999 with "World 
        Free of Violence Against Women", and so on each year until the 
current. More recent themes have included, for example, "Empower 
        Rural Women, End Poverty &amp; Hunger" and "A Promise is a 
Promise - Time for Action to End Violence Against Women".</p>

	<p><strong>2000</strong><br>
        By the new millennium, International Women's Day activity around
 the world had stalled in many 
        countries. The world had moved on and feminism wasn't a popular 
topic. International Women's Day needed re-ignition. There 
        was urgent work to do - battles had not been won and gender 
parity had still not been achieved.</p>

	<p><strong>2001</strong><br>
        The global internationalwomensday.com digital hub for everything
 IWD was launched to re-energize the day as an important platform to 
celebrate 
        the successful achievements of women and to continue calls for 
accelerating gender parity. Each year the IWD website sees 
        vast traffic and is used by millions of people and organizations
 all over the world to learn about and share 
        IWD activity. The IWD website is made possible each year through
 support from corporations committed 
        to driving gender parity. The website's charity of choice for 
many years has been the <a href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/WAGGGS"><b>World Association of Girl Guides 
        and Girl Scouts</b></a> (WAGGGS) whereby IWD fundraising is channelled. A more recent additional charity partnership is with global 
        working women's organization <a href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/Catalyst"><b>Catalyst Inc</b></a>.
 The IWD website adopts an annual campaign theme that is globally 
        relevant for groups and organizations. This campaign theme, one 
of many around the world, provides a framework and direction for 
        annual IWD activity and takes into account the wider agenda of 
both celebration as well as a broad call to action for gender 
        parity. Recent campaign themes have included: #BalanceforBetter,
 #PressforProgress, #BeBoldforChange, #PledgeforParity, #MakeItHappen, 
        #TheGenderAgenda and more. Campaign themes for the global IWD 
website are collaboratively developed each year with stakeholders and 
widely 
        adopted worldwide.</p>

	<p><strong>2011</strong><br>
        2011 saw the 100 year centenary of International Women's Day - 
with the first IWD event held exactly 100 years ago in 1911 in 
        Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. In the United States,
 President Barack Obama proclaimed March 2011 to be "Women's 
        History Month", calling Americans to mark IWD by reflecting on 
"the extraordinary accomplishments of women" in shaping the 
        country's history. The then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
launched the "100 Women Initiative: Empowering Women and Girls 
        through International Exchanges". In the United Kingdom, 
celebrity activist Annie Lennox lead a superb march across one of 
        London's iconic bridges raising awareness in support for global 
charity Women for Women International. Further charities such 
        as Oxfam have run extensive activity supporting IWD and many 
celebrities and business leaders also actively support the day</p>
		  
    <p><strong>2019 and beyond</strong><br>
        The world has witnessed a significant change and attitudinal 
shift in both women's and society's thoughts about women's equality 
        and emancipation. Many from a younger generation may feel that 
'all the battles have been won for women' while many feminists 
        from the 1970's know only too well the longevity and ingrained 
complexity of patriarchy. With more women in the boardroom, 
        greater equality in legislative rights, and an increased 
critical mass of women's visibility as impressive role models in every 
        aspect of life, one could think that women have gained true 
equality. The unfortunate fact is that women are still not paid 
        equally to that of their male counterparts, women still are not 
present in equal numbers in business or politics, and globally 
        women's education, health and the violence against them is worse
 than that of men. However, great improvements have been made. 
        We do have female astronauts and prime ministers, school girls 
are welcomed into university, women can work and have a family, 
        women have real choices. And so each year the world inspires 
women and celebrates their achievements. 
        IWD is an official holiday in many countries including 
Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, 
        China (for women only), Cuba, Georgia, Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Madagascar (for women only), 
        Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nepal (for women only), Russia, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, 
        Vietnam and Zambia. The tradition sees men honouring their 
mothers, wives, girlfriends, colleagues, etc with flowers and 
        small gifts. In some countries IWD has the equivalent status of 
Mother's Day where children give small presents to their 
        mothers and grandmothers.</p> 

        <p>A global web of rich and 
        diverse local activity connects women from all around the world 
ranging from political rallies, business conferences, 
        government activities and networking events through to local 
women's craft markets, theatric performances, fashion parades and 
        more. Many global corporations actively support IWD by running 
their own events and campaigns. For example, on 8 March search 
        engine and media giant Google often changes its 
        <a href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/External.aspx?u=https://www.google.com/doodles?q=International+Women%27s+Day" target="_blank"><b>Google Doodle</b></a> 
        on its global search pages to honor IWD. Year on year IWD is certainly increasing in status.</p>    
    
    <p>So make a difference, think globally and act locally! <br>
        Make everyday International Women's Day. <br>
        Do your bit to ensure that the future for girls is bright, equal, safe and rewarding.</p>

                        <p><b>International Women's Day</b> (March 8) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The 
                            day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity.</p>
                        <p>International Women's Day (IWD) has occurred 
for well over a century, with the 
                            first​ ​IWD gathering in 1911 supported by 
over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. 
Prior to this the​ Socialist Party 
                            of America, United Kingdom's Suffragists and
 Suffragettes, and further groups campaigned for women's equality.</p>
                        <p>Today, IWD belongs to all groups collectively everywhere.</p>
                        <p>IWD is not country, group or organization specific.​</p>
                        <p>Make IWD your day - everyday.</p>
